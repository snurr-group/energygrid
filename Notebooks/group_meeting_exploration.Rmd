### Supporting Information

This section is still largely TODO but at least can be done in part for some of the more important figures.

```{r si_figures}
## hMOF vs. ToBaCCo diagnostic
# When applying the hMOF model to ToBaCCo, is the prediction accuracy related to topological overlap with the hMOFs?
# Previously this was a single color hidden behind ToBaCCo points.  Faceting is probably clearer and more informative, since we can compare hMOF vs. non-hMOF topologies
# NOTE: these data will be incomplete until the 2 bar, 77 K data are filled in the (revised) GCMC spreadsheet, hence why **pcu** is missing.

## Answered questions from meetings

> How does glmnet quantify the error for the residual?  What's the default?

I looked through the source code and found that this is determined via options to `cv.glmnet`.  By default, regression errors use the MSE calculated using 10-fold CV.


## Questions on model formulation and ToBaCCo (dis)agreement

### Multiple linear regression
What does a basic MLR model tell you?  Does that fix the issues fitting ToBaCCo?

Note that trying to set lambda to zero doesn't actually match the fit from `lm`, possibly due to the solution method.  It turns out that the `glmnet` command needs the `thresh` flag set to a stricter tolerance to get the coefficients to match more closely.

```{r mlr_test}
# lambda=0 (unpenalized) ridge regression
mlr_from_glmnet <- 
  gcmc_data %>% 
  mutate(g.L = g.L) %>% 
  run_model_on_partitions(hmof_hist_sets, ., default_binspec, 0, 0)
coef_tbl(mlr_from_glmnet$trained_mod$mod)
print(mlr_from_glmnet)

# R's built-in command `lm` on the standardized data
bind_cols(y=mlr_from_glmnet$trained_mod$y, mlr_from_glmnet$trained_mod$x) %>% lm(data = .)

# A few more attempts at making glmnet match lm
# Standardize doesn't do anything differently since I've already scaled the input data
glmnet(as.matrix(mlr_from_glmnet$trained_mod$x), mlr_from_glmnet$trained_mod$y, alpha=0, lambda=0, standardize=FALSE) %>% coef %>% as.matrix
# Using LASSO doesn't change anything
glmnet(as.matrix(mlr_from_glmnet$trained_mod$x), mlr_from_glmnet$trained_mod$y, alpha=1, lambda=0) %>% coef %>% as.matrix
# Convergence criteria?  Yes, this was the reason for the discrepancies with plain lm.
glmnet(as.matrix(mlr_from_glmnet$trained_mod$x), mlr_from_glmnet$trained_mod$y, alpha=1, lambda=0, thresh=1e-16) %>% coef %>% as.matrix

# Does glmnet's MLR look better for ToBaCCo than earlier?
run_model_on_partitions(tob_hist_sets, tob_y_to_join, default_binspec, 0, lambda=0)

# Now that the MLR details have been sorted out (and the lambda selection is set to minimum CV MSE), how does the pure ToBaCCo model look?
test_with_cv_min <- run_model_on_partitions(tob_hist_sets, tob_y_to_join, default_binspec, 0)
print(test_with_cv_min)
test_with_cv_min$trained_mod$cv_for_lambda %>% plot
# And with a semi-randomly selected lambda?
run_model_on_partitions(tob_hist_sets, tob_y_to_join, default_binspec, 0, lambda=1e-2)

# Finally, how does LASSO perform?
run_model_on_partitions(tob_hist_sets, tob_y_to_join, default_binspec, 1)
```

Even with the knowledge gained from the MLR experiment, it appears that the cv.glmnet function is still having issues properly optimizing lambda the way I want to (poorer Q2 and training data statistics than my manually tuned lambda=0).  This is disappointing because trying a manual lambda of 1e-2 gets a better Q2 as well as the statistics on the testing data.

However, from these runs, we verify that glmnet is indeed using CV error, otherwise the training fit would be better than by semi-randomly selected value.  But maybe part of the reason for the difficulty is that ridge regression is penalizing the important terms too much without excluding the small ones.


### Verify agreement between Scotty and Yamil
Scotty reran ToBaCCo simulations at 5 bar/160 K and 100 bar/77 K to verify consistency between his and Yamil's simulation implementations.  Let's double check that there isn't anything unusual going on here.

## TODO notes from meetings
Different things to consider for the analysis and manuscript.

### General
* Finish a second revision of the outline/manuscript
* Aggregate TODOs into this document to wrap up exploration and decisions

### ToBaCCo errors
* Two separate models for high P and low P?  Might be easier for the model to understand the physics. (have I tried a parity plot of the combined model of separate?  That may be an interesting first step).
* Combining the 1000 + 1000 might be the way to go for the paper, since it also simplifies the story.

### Input accuracy
* Verify against RASPA grids or energy of points at a specified xyz.
* Are we using enough unit cells in the energy calculation?  We should consider calculating this like Yamil and RASPA using perpendicular distances
* FH corrections? (do these actually substantially add to the computational cost?)

### Model formulation
* Check if glmnet's standardize flag is causing the issues with CV.
* Skip all standardization AND set the intercept to zero??
* Recalculate Q2 once we relax the penalty term to be lower.  Beyond RMSE, etc., how does Q2 vary for the models
* Do we need standardization?  If not, consider that it would be easier (for interpretability) not to normalize, and save the justification in the SI.

### Figures 
* Set up better infrastructure for automating figure generation
* Label Q2 (and other stats?) directly on the plot.
* Make these figures much bigger so we don't have to squint/zoom
* Set the size of the figures within R to get consistent font sizes and typefaces.
* "training on a combined database" should use independent data for training and testing
* Beta plot: consider drawing the background as the average histogram of the data.  Betas could be drawn as hlines instead of dots.
* Consider drawing in [cowplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html)

### Other from group meeting 12/7
* Beta interpretation: Why do strongly attractive energies not have a highly negative beta?  You'd expect it to be wasted pore volume like the "Inf" bin, thus have a similar beta.
* What about higher T for desorption?
* vf distribution of the ToBaCCo MOFs?  How similar is it to the hMOFs?
* Recall the plot on ToBaCCo error vs. LCD.
* L10 would have a low LCD since it's short. (TODO: plot distribution of pore sizes.  Do these tend as significantly smaller?)
* How do the range of the hMOF and ToBaCCo energies compare?  Is the maximally attractive ToBaCCo region significantly lower than the hMOFs?
* Should the lowest ToBaCCo bins be included with the top bin?
* Can we optimize uptake for a given bin (calculating a maximum adsorption for an artificial pseudo-MOF using the histogram bins?)

### Code
* Place standardization as a flag for model fitting instead of repeated functions like `no_std_fit_glmnet` in the `no_standardization` code block

### Unfinished from tobacco_exploration.Rmd
* Somehow filter out all of the metallic CCDC structures.
* Regenerate plots using traditional textural property descriptors.  Maybe a hybrid model would fix training issues, since it's largely PLD driven?
* Re-implement prediction workflow in C++? (only necessary if we release an online interface)

#### Data that still needs a final version
* Wilmer's CH4 data to compare against the chemical intutition paper?

#### Other possible directions
* What sort of capacity could you get with a uniform background potential?
* Consider generating parity plots, faceted by bin and colored by beta*z (the model contribution).  Do these appear consistent between the hMOFs and ToBaCCo?  Maybe the problem is bin 19 and the difference between a z of 0.5-2.0 (hMOFs) and -1 to 0 (ToBaCCo). Maybe a different bin would help?
* Make a few parity plots from the Q2 analysis.  Is the good prediction consistent across histogram parameters?  How about for ToBaCCo, since it's likely more sensitive?
* Separate hMOF models by topology?  Does the error depend on the number of distinct pores in the various topologies?
* Testing FH on a subset of MOFs (worst performing) to see how sensitive the energy is.
* Trying out traditional textural properties, or adding them to my set of energy-based features
* Would it be helpful to run PCA on the hMOF and/or ToBaCCo feature matricies?  Maybe the scores would show clustering between good/bad performance?
* Is there a relationship between the betas at different P/T?  That could help optimize operating parameters if we can interpolate predictive models.
* Do we have examples of similar histograms but completely different performance?

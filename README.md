Notebook for adsorption predictions
===========================

Objective
---------
Predict adsorption characteristics of MOFs using machine learning based on the potential energy of interactions with adsorbents


TODO
----
* Delegate CIF I/O to a different library than PyMatGen for portability (clusters, Windows, etc)
* Optimize code with numpy vectorization
* Test performance.  Explore RASPA's built-in grid methods and/or GPU acceleration
* Reorganize Arun's code into my project framework.  Or perhaps not, since it's part of one package together.
